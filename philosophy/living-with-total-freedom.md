# Living with Total Freedom

- Freedom First.
- Embrace uncertainty, ride life’s waves without clinging to calmness or control.
- Live fully in the moment, finding joy in the beauty, irony, and quirks of everyday life.
- Observe without judgement.
- Let your values shape your choices.
- Accept that life is absurd and use it as a source of liberation.
- Challenge societal norms that don’t align with your values, and shape your own path.
- Engage with others in ways that encourage their freedom and agency, as well as your own.
- Embrace paradoxes.
- Detach your self-worth from people, ideologies, identities, and possessions.
- Embrace uncertainty, allowing life to unfold without clinging to specific outcomes.
- Question every belief, including your own.
