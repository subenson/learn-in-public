# Strength Training

## Base Thesis

- Strength training should be periodized to align with different phases of the running season, focusing on different aspects (e.g., foundational strength, power development) at appropriate times.
- Exercises should target the muscles and movement patterns most relevant to running, enhancing performance and reducing injury risk.

## Common Mistakes

- Lifting like a bodybuilder
- Overemphasis on stability training

## Implementation

- Focus on compound movements. Engage multiple muscle groups that match the functional demand of running.
- Incorporate plyometric exercises and movements like power cleans to enhance power and explosiveness, contributing to improved speed.
