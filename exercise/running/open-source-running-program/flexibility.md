# Flexibility

## Base Thesis

Improving your natural range of motion can improve your running technique and increase your stride length while reducing your risk of injury.

## Dynamic Stretching

Dynamic stretching is a good way to stretch muscle groups before the muscles are warmed up. This increases blood circulation, improves joint mobility, and increases muscle power compared to static stretching or not stretching at all.

## Static Stretching

Static stretching lengthens your muscle fibers as well as the connective tissue around and at the ends of your muscle fibers. After running take 10 minutes to stretch your major muscle groups.
