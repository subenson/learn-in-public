# Non-fiction writing

## Be yourself

Readers will notice if you are putting on airs.
Readers want the person who is talking to them sound genuine.
Therefor a funamental rule is: be yourself.

Writers are at their most natural when they write in the first person.
Writing is a transaction between two people conducted on paper (or screen), and it will go well to the extend that it retains its humanity.
Try to use "I" and "me", and "we" and "us".

Never say anything in writing that you wouldn't confortably say in a conversation. If you're not a person who says "moreover" or who calls someone an "individual", don't write it.

## Humor

Don't worry about whether the reader will "get it" if you indulge a sudden impulse of humor.
If it amuses you in the act of writing, put it in.
It can always be removed, but only you can put it in.
You are writing primarily to please yourself, and if you go about it with enjoyment you will also entertain the readers who are worth writing for.
You are who you are and the reader is who he/she is, and either you'll get along or you won't.

## Unity

Unity is the anchor of good writing.
It keeps the reader from straggling off in all directions.
It satisfies your readers subconscious need for order.

**Unity of pronoun:**
Are you going to write in the first person, third person, or as a participants.

**Unity of tense:**
You must choose the tense in which you are principally going to address the reader. You can still take glances backward and forward along the way.

**Unity of mood:**
Any tone in which to approach the reader is acceptable, but don't mix two or three.

It often happens that you'll make the prior decisions and then discover that they weren't the right ones.
The material leads you in an unexpected direction, where you're more comfortable in a different tone.
Don't fight such a current if it feels right.
If it happens, the second part of your article will be badly out of joint with the first part.
At least you'll know which parts are truest to your instinct.
Go back to the beginning and rewrite it so that your mood and style are consistent from start to finish.

## Lead

The important sentence is the first one.
If it doesn't induce the reader to proceed to the second, your article is dead.
You keep tugging the reader until he is hooked.
Do not count on the reader to stick around.
Readers want to know what's in it for them.
The lead must capture the reader immediately and force him to keep reading.
It must provide hard details that tell the reader why the piece was written and why he ought to read it.

Every paragraph should amplify the one that preceded it.
Give more thought to adding solid detail and less to entertaining the reader.
But take special care with the last sentence of each paragraph - it's the crucial springboard to the next paragraph.
Try to give that sentence an extra twist of humor or surprise.

## Ending

An article that doesn't stop where it should stop becomes a drag and therefore a failure.
You'll know when you have arrived at the end when you are about to repeat in compressed form what you have already said in detail.
The tension you have built begins to sag and the readers interest drops.
The readers are not too dumb to get the point.
Failure to know where the last sentence should occur can wreck an article that until it sfinal stage has been tightly constructed.

The perfect ending should take your readers slightly by surprise and yet seem exactly right.
If you have presented all the facts and made the point you want to make, look for the nearest exit.
Often it takes just a few sentences to wrap things up.
It's like the curtain in a theatrical comedy.
We are in the middle of a scene, when suddenly one of the actors says something funny, or outrageous, and the lights go out.
