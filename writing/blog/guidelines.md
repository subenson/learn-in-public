# Blog writing

Readers will notice if you are putting on airs.
Readers want the person who is talking to them sound genuine.
Therefor a funamental rule is: be yourself.

Writers are at their most natural when they write in the first person.
Writing is a transaction between two people conducted on paper (or screen), and it will go well to the extend that it retains its humanity.
Try to use "I" and "me", and "we" and "us".

Don't worry about whether the reader will "get it" if you indulge a sudden impulse of humor.
If it amuses you in the act of writing, put it in.
It can always be removed, but only you can put it in.
You are writing primarily to please yourself, and if you go about it with enjoyment you will also entertain the readers who are worth writing for.
You are who you are and the reader is who he/she is, and either you'll get along or you won't.

Never say anything in writing that you wouldn't confortably say in a conversation. If you're not a person who says "moreover" or who calls someone an "individual", don't write it.
