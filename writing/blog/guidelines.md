# Blog writing

Readers will notice if you are putting on airs.
Readers want the person who is talking to them sound genuine.
Therefor a funamental rule is: be yourself.

Writers are at their most natural when they write in the first person.
Writing is a transaction between two people conducted on paper (or screen), and it will go well to the extend that it retains its humanity.
Try to use "I" and "me", and "we" and "us".

Don't worry about whether the reader will "get it" if you indulge a sudden impulse of humor.
If it amuses you in the act of writing, put it in.
It can always be removed, but only you can put it in.
You are writing primarily to please yourself, and if you go about it with enjoyment you will also entertain the readers who are worth writing for.
You are who you are and the reader is who he/she is, and either you'll get along or you won't.

Never say anything in writing that you wouldn't confortably say in a conversation. If you're not a person who says "moreover" or who calls someone an "individual", don't write it.

## Unity

Unity is the anchor of good writing.
It keeps the reader from straggling off in all directions.
It satisfies your readers subconscious need for order.

**Unity of pronoun:**
Are you going to write in the first person, third person, or as a participants.

**Unity of tense:**
You must choose the tense in which you are principally going to address the reader. You can still take glances backward and forward along the way.

**Unity of mood:**
Any tone in which to approach the reader is acceptable, but don't mix two or three.

It often happens that you'll make the prior decisions and then discover that they weren't the right ones.
The material leads you in an unexpected direction, where you're more comfortable in a different tone.
Don't fight suc a current if it feels right.
If it happens the second part of your article will be badly out of joint with the first part.
At least you'll know which parts are truest to your instinct.
Go back to the beginning and rewrite it so that your mood and style are consistent from start to finish.
